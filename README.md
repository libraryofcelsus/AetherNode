# AetherNode
A Simple Local API for Open-Source LLMs.  Only Llama-2-Chat for now.

This Repository is mostly just an experiment for now.  I may end up using this as a solution for my Ai Assistant/Agent project.  That project can be found here: https://github.com/libraryofcelsus/Aetherius_AI_Assistant
